                Fondly known as the ‘Missile Man’ for the initiatives he took while he was associated with the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) technologies developed by him are being used by the organizations even in present times.
             </p>
             <p>
                “Excellence is a continuous process and not an accident,” believed the former President of India, and that is exactly what he did in DRDO and ISRO in order to make India a superpower in space science and technology.

                Kalam easily won the election and was sworn in as India’s 11th president, a largely ceremonial post, in July 2002. He remained committed to using science and technology to transform India into a developed country. In 2007 Kalam left office and was succeeded by Pratibha Patil, the country’s first woman president.

An unlikely compromise candidate for president, he soon became the most popular occupant of that exalted post, disregarding its customary ceremonial role to reach out to ordinary people, particularly the young.
